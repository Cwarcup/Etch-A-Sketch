# Etch-A-Sketch

Browser version of a sketchppad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Have fun!

[Live Demo](https://cwarcup.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/) :point_left:

## Functionality

    Hovering over the grid will results in each box changing color.
    Color can be changed by clicking the buttons.
    The Rainbow button will use a random RGB value to fill in the box color.
    Incrementally Dark will darken each box so that it takes exactly 10 passes for each box to get the box black.
